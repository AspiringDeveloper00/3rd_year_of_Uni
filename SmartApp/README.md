This simple web app is a dummy app of a smart home during the times of the global pandemic. It has no databases, no true functionality other than displaying messages. The only role of this university project was to make an app that was user friendly and understandable by people of all ages. I used html5,css and javascript. Simple stuff just to get a reminder of html5 and css (basic front end).
